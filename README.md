# Data-challenge

Hi an welcome to my data Challeng repository. Here you can find my take on a small data science challenge containing data of am UN GHG-repot.

Greenhouse.py is the main file and can be excuted
config_file.py is for configuring some of the parameters and plotting names
Data_preperation takes care of data wrangling, importing and exporting
plotting contains severl Bokeh plots

please create a virtual enviroment using the requirements.txt file for package handling
